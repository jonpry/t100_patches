Has working backlight. HS200 eMMC, bunch of fixes for timeouts. 

A lot of this code is real bad, hacked together and will only work on T100. Some of the code is just stuff i tried but now is known to not be needed. Other probably not needed but would require more testing. 

Add acpi_backlight=vendor to kernel command line
